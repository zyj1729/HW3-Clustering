        Fits the kmeans algorithm onto a provided 2D matrix.

        The intent here is to have this method find the k cluster centers from the data
        with the tolerance, then you will use .predict() to identify the
        clusters that best match some data that is provided.

        In sklearn there is also a fit_predict() method that combines these
        functions, but for now we will have you implement them both separately.
